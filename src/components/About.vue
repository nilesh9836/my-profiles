        I’m Nilesh, I’m a frontend developer,
        and I specialize in efficient Vue apps and CSS & HTML that just work across
        all platforms and browsers. I care deeply about building interfaces that are
        usable and pleasant for the most number of people possible.
My professional life has been 100% driven by my passion for design and structure. I
was sketching crazy detailed 3d models for fun when I was a kid, started building
promo websites for small businesses while in college. For three years, I have been working for a product based company where we develop
a lots of functionality in my product which are helpful for our clients.
Right now, I’m excited about the still very complicated WebAssembly, and working towards
becoming a Vue senior. In the following years, I also plan to explore the “server-side” more
and become a better-rounded full-stack dev.
